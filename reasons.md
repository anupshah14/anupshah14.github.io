Why the cloud is awesome
========================
* Use a virtual machine for your research &mdash; free up your own computer for your own use
* Access your virtual machine from anywhere
* Share resources easily with collaborators via the virtual machine
* Run a web service with no overhead
* Test software without compromising your own computer
* Try things out &mdash; and then shut down and walk away
* Get access to extra computation
* Combine the virtual machine with federally funded storage so your project has the resources it needs
