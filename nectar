Accessing the NeCTAR cloud
==========================

Any Australian researcher with [AAF credentials](http://aaf.edu.au/) can use the [NeCTAR cloud](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/).
This includes all universities and most Australian research centres.

You can launch virtual machines of different sizes, from very small instances that run a Web server, to large clusters that run complicated processes such as gene seqencing pipelines, complex models or simulations.
