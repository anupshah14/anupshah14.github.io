<h1>Accessing the NeCTAR cloud</h1>

<p>Any Australian researcher with <a href="http://aaf.edu.au/">AAF credentials</a> can use the <a href="https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/">NeCTAR cloud</a>.
This includes all universities and most Australian research centres.</p>

<p>You can launch virtual machines of different sizes, from very small instances that run a Web server, to large clusters that run complicated processes such as gene seqencing pipelines, complex models or simulations.</p>
