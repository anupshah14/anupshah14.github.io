Ideas for carpentry.

Not sure how relevant it is to the cloud. But as someone who started off from scratch
with python, trying to find out/understand what specific programs/GUIs to use was difficult.
Everyone was using a different GUI (PyCharm, Idle, Spyder etc) and without any background 
I could never distinguish the differences. So I don't think it necessarily has to be part of the lesson,
but if there was a link that listed the main cloud services and maybe the differences between them it 
might provide a bit of clarity. 

Good Luck!
