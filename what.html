<p>Tom was working on his research project for which he just got his data on Friday morning. He has a deadline to finish the analysis of the data and report it by Monday. Luckily, he has an access to a cloud where he has install all the softwares. Now all he needs is a internet access and he can access his machine anywhere from the world. He is now enjoying his weekend at home without worring to show up in the lab. </p>

<h3>Michelle Big data analysis</h3>

<p>Michelle is a clinician trying to understand DNA from cancer cells. The new genome sequencers generate Terabites (TBs) of data. But her desktop cannot handle these files. Now with the Research cloud she can use 200 CPUs in parallel without actually need to buy 200 computers and get her job done.</p>
