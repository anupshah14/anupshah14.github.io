<h1>Why the cloud is awesome</h1>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a virtual machine for your research &mdash; and free up your own computer for your own use</li>
<li>Launch a virtual machine just for yourself, or share it on a project</li>
<li>Access the virtual machine from anywhere</li>
<li>Share resources easily with collaborators &mdash; no authentication or firewall dramas</li>
<li>Run a web service with no overhead</li>
<li>Test software and code without risking your own computer</li>
<li>Try things out &mdash; then shut down and walk away</li>
<li>Get access to extra computation when you need it</li>
<li>Combine the virtual machine with federally funded storage so your project has the resources it needs</li>
</ul>
